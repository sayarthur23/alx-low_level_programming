#Functions, nested loops

Project done during "Software Engineering" program with "ALX Africa"
The goal is to learn about header files, functions, loops and nested loops in **C language**.

##Technologies
* C files are compiled using gcc
* C files are written according to the C90 strandard
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04

##Files
All of the following files are programs written in C:

| filename | description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| 0-putchar.c | prints putchar |
| 1-alphabet.c | prints the alphabet in lowercase |
| 2-print_aplphabet_x10.c | prints 10 times the alphabet in lowercase |
| 3-islower.c | checks for lowercase character |
| 4-isalpha.c | checks for alphabetic character |
| 5-sign.c | prints the sign of a number |
| 6-abs.c | computes the absolute value of an integer |
| 7-print_last_digit.c | prints the last digit of a number |
| 8-24_hours.c | prints every minute of the day |
| 9-times_table.c | printsthe 9 times table, strating with 0 |
| 10-add.c | adds two integers and returns the resulrs |
| 11-print_to_98.c | prints all natural numbers from n to 98 |
| 100-times_table.c | prints the n times table starting with 0 |
